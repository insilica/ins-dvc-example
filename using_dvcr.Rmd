```

## install
```{r}
devtools::install_github("git@github.com:insilica/dvcr.git")
library(dvcr)
```
## Using DVC with R 
```{r}
data_dir <- here::here("data")
dir.create()
cars_filename <- file.path(data_dir,"cars.txt")
save(cars,file=cars_filename)

# be sure to have dvc installed

# this should fail, but is left as example
dvcr::use_dvc()
dvcr::add(path=data_dir)

```

You should also commit the data.dvc file generated
```{sh}
git add data.dvc
```

```{r}
# this will also fail, but kept as example
dvcr::remote_add(name = "s3", url = "s3://ins-dvc/ins-dvc-example")
s3_remote = "s3"
push(remote=s3_remote)

# if this was the first time you downloaded the repo, you could do a
pull()
```
